About
=====

**hover-dns-updater** will update the Hover DNS entries for one or more
DNS records based on the external IP address. **hover-dns-updater** can
do this one time or can run continuously checking after a certain amount
of time.

Installation
============

Prerequisites:
--------------

-   Python 3  
    -   [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    (https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/217282267-Enable-two-step-sign-in-on-your-Hover-account)

Hover DNS IDs:
--------------

-   Login to [Hover.com](https://hover.com)
-   In the same browser go to
    https://www.hover.com/api/domains/YOURDOMAIN.COM/dns replacing
    YOURDOMAIN.COM with the domain you want to update
-   This will return a json file. If you use Firefox, this will be
    nicely formatted.
-   In the "entries" list, look for the DNS records you want to keep up
    to date and make a note of the associated "id"s. They should look
    something like "dns1234567"

Install Ubuntu service:
-----------------------

-   Copy INSTALL.sh, hover-dns-updater.service, and hover-dns-updater.py
    to a folder on you Ubuntu system
-   ./INSTALL.sh
-   This will install and enable, but not start, the hover-dns-updater
    service
-   sudo nano /etc/hover-dns-updater/hover-dns-updater.json (or use the editor of your choice)  
    -   Fill in your hover username and password
    -   Add the dns ids you noted above
    -   Optional - change None to the log file name
    -   Optional - change poll time, in seconds. Default is 10 minutes
    -   When running as an Ubuntu service, the service value in the
        confg file is ignored.

-   After configuration file is updated, start the service
    sudo service hover-dns-updater start
-   Option - Verify service started correctly
    sudo service hover-dns-updater status

RancherOS
---------

I am using RancherOS to host and manage Docker running in a lightweight
VM on FreeNAS. Here are the docker-compose.yml and rancher-compose.yml
to easily recreate the container.

### docker-compose.yml:

>     volumes:
>         logs:
